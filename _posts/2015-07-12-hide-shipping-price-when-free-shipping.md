By default, WooCommerce shows the shipping price during checkout even when free
shipping is available.

The following snippet will unset flat_rate shipping if free shipping is set during
checkout.

    <?php
    add_filter( 'woocommerce_package_rates',  'hide_shipping_when_free_is_available', 10, 2 );

    /**
     * @param array $rates Array of rates found for the package
     * @param array $package The package array/object being shipped
     * @return array of modified rates
     */
    function hide_shipping_when_free_is_available( $rates, $package ) {

      // Only modify rates if free_shipping is present
        if ( isset( $rates['free_shipping'] ) ) {

          // This unsets the single flat_rate shipping
          unset( $rates['flat_rate'] );

          // This unsets all methods except for free_shipping
          $free_shipping          = $rates['free_shipping'];
          $rates                  = array();
          $rates['free_shipping'] = $free_shipping;
      }

      return $rates;
    }
